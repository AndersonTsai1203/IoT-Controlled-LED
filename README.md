# IoT Controlled LED

The simplest IoT project where an LED can be turned on or off remotely via AWS IoT Core. It’s often considered the “Hello World” of IoT projects.

## Components

1. LED
2. Raspberry Pi or Arduino
3. AWS IoT Core

## Learning Goals

- Understanding basic cloud-to-device control.
- Working with GPIO pins to control LEDs.
- Building the foundation for more complex IoT projects.

## Extensions

- Add multiple LEDs for more control or use RGB LEDs to display different colors.
